# Refactor

Refactor: improve structure, readability, maintainability. Preserve external behavior.

## Process

### 0. Baseline first

Run the relevant suite and confirm green BEFORE touching anything. A failing
baseline means fix or report first — a refactor cannot prove
behavior-preservation against a broken start.

### 1. Understand the current structure

Inspect:

- architecture, layout
- recent git history, momentum
- duplication, coupling, readability problems
- validations protecting behavior

Load relevant skills:

- `python` or `typescript` for impl patterns
- `security` if change touches sensitive code paths

### 2. Choose narrow refactor target

One maintainability problem at time:

- duplicated logic
- unclear module boundaries
- high coupling
- poor naming in recently changed code
- deeply nested or hard-to-scan flow
- mixed responsibilities in one class/function

### 3. Refactor in small steps

- one logical change at time
- validate after each meaningful step
- preserve public behavior unless explicitly asked
- keep style churn out of diff

### 4. Report clearly

Summarize:

- what improved
- what intentionally left alone
- what validated
- remaining risks or follow-up ideas

## Constraints

- preserve external behavior
- no sneaked feature work
- don't rewrite stable code because old
- don't mix broad renames with structural changes unless required
- if correctness or security bug found requiring behavioral change, stop and surface separately -- don't fold into refactor
