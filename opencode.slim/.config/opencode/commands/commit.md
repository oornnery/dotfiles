# Commit

Create small, coherent commits from current working tree. Keep staging explicit, safe.

## Safety rules

- never use `git add .` or `git add -A`
- never amend unless explicitly asked
- never push unless explicitly asked
- never skip hooks with `--no-verify`
- never include secrets or credential-like files

Broader git workflow: `git` skill.

## Process

### 1. Assess the working tree

Check:

```bash
git status
git diff --stat
git diff --stat --cached
git log --oneline -5
```

### 2. Group changes into logical units

- one commit per coherent feature, fix, refactor, docs, or test change
- separate unrelated edits
- if needed, stage hunks with `git add -p`
- if work changed scope, decisions, validation, or next steps, update project state before staging

### 3. Stage by name

Stage files explicitly. Warn if sensitive files appear in diff:

- `.env`
- `*.pem`
- `credentials.*`
- `.mem/private/*`

### 4. Write the commit message

Use Conventional Commits:

```text
type(scope): concise imperative description
```

Common types:

- `feat`
- `fix`
- `refactor`
- `docs`
- `test`
- `chore`
- `perf`
- `ci`
- `build`

Rules:

- subject under 72 characters
- imperative mood
- add body only when WHY not obvious
- use configured git identity
- do not add AI signatures or co-author lines unless explicitly requested

### 5. Commit and verify

After each commit:

```bash
git status
```

Confirm what remains uncommitted before creating another commit.

## Output

Report:

- logical commit groups proposed or created
- final commit message(s)
- anything intentionally left unstaged
- any blocked or risky files skipped

## Constraints

- do not mix unrelated edits in one commit
- do not hide failing hooks
- do not override git author config
- do not assume clean tree without checking
