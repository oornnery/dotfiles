name: plan
description: Create a structured implementation plan or design document. Use when the user wants a SPEC, ARCH, or SDD before implementation.

# Plan

Produce plan document, not code. Plan should make impl, testing, rollout concrete without over-specifying code.

## When to use

Use this command for:

- new features with multiple moving parts
- architecture or layering decisions
- ambiguous requests needing phased execution
- work benefiting from SPEC, ARCH, or SDD output

## Process

### 1. Clarify the request

Identify:

- goal and scope
- explicit constraints
- non-goals
- affected users or systems
- success criteria

### 2. Inspect the current system

Read only enough to answer:

- what architecture already in use
- which files or modules likely affected
- where boundaries already exist
- what validations and tests prove success

Load supporting skills only when needed:

- `project-state` for SPEC.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, DESIGN.md, ROADMAP.md, .state, or .mem updates
- `verification` for validation plan and check selection
- `python` or `typescript` for impl and toolchain constraints
- `security` for trust boundaries and risk
- `docs` for ADR or design-doc formatting

### 3. Design the change

Define:

- architecture changes
- boundaries and interfaces
- ordered phases
- data flow or request flow
- risks and mitigations
- testing strategy

Use diagrams only when they add clarity.

### 4. Write the plan

Use this shape:

```text
# Implementation Plan: [Feature]

## Overview

## Architecture Changes

## Phases

## Testing Strategy

## Risks and Mitigations

## Success Criteria
```

When the plan is intended to persist across sessions, write or update `SPEC.md`
and `.state/current.md` using the `project-state` skill.

### 5. Keep it implementation-ready

Each phase independently verifiable and specific about:

- file paths or affected components
- contracts or interfaces
- migration or rollout concerns
- how to validate completion

## Constraints

- do not implement during planning
- prefer extending current architecture over rewriting it
- do not hide uncertainty; surface assumptions and risks
- avoid speculative abstractions
